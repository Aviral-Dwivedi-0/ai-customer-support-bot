## 💡 Key Technical Decisions

### 1. **Model Selection**: Gemini 2.5 Flash
- **Why**: Latest stable model, fast, supports long contexts
- **Alternative considered**: gemini-pro (not available in current API)

### 2. **Prompt Engineering**
Improved prompt structure for better FAQ matching:
```
- Explicit instructions for FAQ-only responses
- Clear escalation trigger word
- Context-aware conversation flow
- Friendly, conversational tone
```

### 3. **Database Design**
Simple SQLite schema:
```sql
conversations (
    session_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,
    history TEXT
)
```

### 4. **Error Handling**
- API key validation at startup
- Graceful Gemini API error handling
- Input validation on all endpoints
- Try-catch blocks for robustness

## 📊 API Examples

### Example 1: FAQ Query
**Request:**
```json
POST /chat
{
  "session_id": "user123",
  "query": "Do you ship internationally?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "Yes, we do! We ship to over 50 countries worldwide. Shipping costs will vary depending on your location."
}
```

### Example 2: Context Memory
**Request 1:**
```json
POST /chat
{
  "session_id": "user456",
  "query": "What is your return policy?"
}
```

**Response 1:**
```json
{
  "response": "You can return products within 30 days of purchase with original packaging and receipt."
}
```

**Request 2:**
```json
POST /chat
{
  "session_id": "user456",
  "query": "How many days do I have?"
}
```

**Response 2:**
```json
{
  "response": "You have 30 days from the date of purchase to return items!"
}
```

### Example 3: Escalation
**Request:**
```json
POST /chat
{
  "session_id": "user789",
  "query": "What is the weather today?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "response": "I can't answer that question. I will escalate this to a human agent.\n\nSummary for agent:\nUser asked about today's weather."
}
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables (.env)
```
GEMINI_API_KEY=AIzaSyAj3em_GO9AKHMmKqvJjzaY26jV7zkWcwM
```

### Model Configuration
```python
generation_config = {
    "temperature": 0.7,      # Balanced creativity
    "top_p": 0.95,           # Diverse responses
    "top_k": 40,             # Token selection
    "max_output_tokens": 1024  # Response length
}
```

---

## 📦 Dependencies

All installed and verified:
```
flask==3.0.0
google-generativeai==0.3.1
python-dotenv==1.0.0
requests
```

## 🎓 What I Learned / Technical Highlights

1. **Gemini API Evolution**: Original documentation specified `gemini-pro`, but the current API requires `gemini-2.5-flash` or newer models.

2. **Prompt Engineering**: The key to success was explicit instructions:
   - "Answer based ONLY on FAQs"
   - "Respond with ESCALATE if not in FAQs"
   - Context-aware with conversation history

3. **Error Recovery**: Added diagnostics (`diagnose.py`, `list_models.py`) to troubleshoot API issues systematically.

4. **Flask Auto-Reload**: Debug mode automatically reloads on code changes, perfect for iterative development.

## 📝 Important Notes

1. **API Key Security**: The `.env` file is in `.gitignore` and will NOT be committed to git
2. **Database**: `conversations.db` is also ignored in git - regenerated on first run
3. **Model Compatibility**: Always check available models with `list_models.py`
4. **Development Server**: Flask's built-in server is for development only
